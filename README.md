# CS2 External Game Hack
***(IMPORTANT: PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS FOR BAD INTENTIONS OR RUINING PEOPLE’S GAMING EXPERIENCE, EVERYTHING HERE WAS MADE IN OFFLINE MATCHES AGAINST BOTS.)***

Over the course of a year and a half, this was a project that a friend and I built while learning about game hacking development.
Much of the codebase is old, as I was attempting to learn how to create GUI elements in C++ alongside everything here.

This game hack uses a kernel driver to read memory from CS2 (writing memory is a no-go because of how valve detects writing to addresses).

# Loading the Driver
I used kdmapper for the longest time to load the driver, however I just recommend enabling test signing to load the driver as it doesn't matter as much in terms of being undetected.
